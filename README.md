📌 Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of Namma Yatri, a ride-hailing platform. The objective was to identify demand patterns, cancellations, payment preferences, and zone-level performance, and translate these into business strategies.

The work is divided into:

Technical Methodology Report (PPT) – Data prep, joins, cleaning, calculated fields, and exploratory visualizations.

Business Decision-Making Report (PPT) – Key findings, operational insights, and actionable recommendations.

Tableau Dashboard – A consolidated interactive dashboard.

Written Report – Step-by-step answers to assigned tasks.

📊 Key Insights

Peak demand during commute hours (8–10 AM & 6–8 PM).

UPI dominates payment methods, driving the largest revenue share.

Driver cancellations exceed customer cancellations → operational inefficiency.

Top 5 pickup zones generate the majority of rides & revenue.

Midday ride conversions are weaker → promotions needed.
